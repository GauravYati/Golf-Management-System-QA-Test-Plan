# Golf-Management-System-QA-Test-Plan
The Test Plan is an aggregation of information which describes the entire testing activity for this project. It encompasses all levels of testing, including unit, development testing, system verification testing (SVT), and beta testing. It defines product requirements, testing scope, schedule, resource allocation, quality goals, assumptions, exclusions, and risk assessments.
This test plan outlines the testing strategy for GolfScore Release 1.1, a command-line software application developed to process golf tournament scores and produce structured output reports. The plan provides the testing objectives, tools, resource needs, risk considerations, and schedules to ensure the software fulfills its functional and performance requirements.
